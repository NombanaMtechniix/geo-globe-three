Adding GeoJSON data
- The core feature is rendering country boundaries from GeoJSON data.
- You can provide a GeoJSON file via a simple data loader function.
- You can switch between different GeoJSON sources to display other geographies (countries, regions, or custom boundaries).

Data sources and formats
- GeoJSON is a common format for geographic features. Each country is a feature with properties such as name, code, and population.
- The project expects a valid TopoJSON or GeoJSON file containing polygon boundaries.
- When you update the GeoJSON data, the 3D mesh should reflect boundaries accurately on the globe.

Usage basics
- The globe rotates slowly by default, with user controls to pan, zoom, and tilt.
- You can enable auto-rotation, slow-down on user input, and smooth camera movements.
- There are layers for landmasses, boundaries, and optional markers for points of interest.

How it works
- The 3D globe is a sphere mapped with a texture or shaded to convey land and water.
- GeoJSON boundaries are projected onto the sphere using a spherical projection.
- A dedicated shader or standard material renders borders with adjustable thickness and color.
- Interaction is handled through pointer events, raycasting for picking, and camera controls.

Design decisions
- Performance first: use efficient geometry generation and batching for GeoJSON features.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation for camera control, screen reader-friendly labels for features.
- Theming: light and dark themes with clear contrast for readability in various lighting conditions.
- Extensibility: layers are modular. You can add new layers like population density, weather, or political boundaries with minimal changes.
- Type safety: TypeScript types for GeoJSON features and 3D entities help prevent common mistakes.

Customization and theming
- Dark and light themes
  - Tailwind utility classes drive color and backgrounds.
  - The theme switch updates global CSS variables to apply consistent colors.
- Visual styles
  - Change the color of land, oceans, and borders.
  - Adjust border thickness and glow to meet your design goals.
- Camera and controls
  - Adjust the initial camera position to focus on a particular region.
  - Control rotation speed, damping, and zoom limits.
- GeoJSON styling
  - Feature-based styling lets you color countries by attributes.
  - Highlight selected countries on hover or click.

Advanced customization
- Add markers for cities or landmarks
  - Simple 3D objects (cones or pins) placed at coordinates.
- Layer interactivity
  - Enable tooltips when hovering over a country.
  - Show country codes or names in an overlay panel.
- Data-driven visuals
  - Bind data such as population, GDP, or area to color scales.

Architecture and code structure
- Separation of concerns
  - The Globe component focuses on 3D rendering and camera state.
  - The GeoLayer handles GeoJSON parsing and mesh creation.
  - The Controls component encapsulates user interactions.
- Reusable utilities
  - Projection utilities convert GeoJSON coordinates to 3D positions on a sphere.
  - Geo helpers provide helpers for feature iteration and property access.
- Type safety
  - TypeScript interfaces describe GeoJSON features, properties, and 3D entities.
  - Strong typing reduces runtime surprises and enhances IDE support.

Performance and troubleshooting
- Performance tips
  - Use low-polygon geometry for large GeoJSON datasets.
  - Batch rendering of features to reduce draw calls.
  - Debounce UI interactions to keep the frame rate steady.
- Troubleshooting common issues
  - WebGL not available: provide a fallback or message.
  - Slow performance with large GeoJSON: simplify boundaries or render a subset.
  - UI not responsive: check Tailwind setup and responsive utilities.
- Debugging tips
  - Inspect camera state and orbit controls to ensure smooth motion.
  - Verify GeoJSON parsing for polygon rings and coordinate order.
  - Log rendering stats to identify bottlenecks.

Accessibility and inclusive design
- Keyboard and screen reader support
  - Clear focus states for interactive controls.
  - Accessible labels for control elements and information overlays.
- Color contrast
  - Ensure border and land colors maintain readability in both themes.
- Responsive behavior
  - The globe scales to fit various viewports, from mobile to desktop.

Testing and quality assurance
- Unit tests
  - Test projection math in projection.ts for several sample coordinates.
  - Mock GeoJSON to verify that the layer converts features to meshes correctly.
- Integration tests
  - Ensure camera controls respond to user input without glitches.
  - Validate that toggling theme updates CSS variables consistently.
- Visual regression
  - Snapshot the globe rendering with different data sets and themes.

Data handling and GeoJSON notes
- GeoJSON basics
  - Polygons represent country shapes; multipolygons handle territories with multiple rings.
  - The properties object typically includes code, name, and region category.
- Data sources
  - Public datasets for GeoJSON country boundaries are widely available.
  - You can curate a local dataset or fetch from a remote API, depending on your needs.
- Data validation
  - Validate input GeoJSON before rendering to avoid runtime errors.
  - Normalize coordinate orders if needed (lon/lat vs lat/lon).

Deployment and hosting
- Static site hosting
  - Build artifacts can be hosted on Vercel, Netlify, or any static host compatible with Next.js.
- Server-side rendering
  - Use Next.js server features sparingly when rendering GeoJSON-heavy pages to avoid long build times.
- Environment variables
  - Use environment variables for API endpoints if you fetch GeoJSON data at runtime.

Examples and demos
- Basic globe example
  - A minimal globe with land and borders loaded from a local GeoJSON file.
- Themed globe
  - A globe with light and dark themes and a toggle in the header.
- Interactive bounds
  - Click on a country to highlight and display a tooltip with the country name.

Code snippets (selected)
- Simple loader for GeoJSON
  - import geojson from '../data/world.geojson';
  - // Use a loader to parse and pass features into the GeoLayer
- Basic Globe usage
  - <Globe
      radius={1}
      textureUrl="/textures/earth.jpg"
      geoJson={geojson}
      onCountryClick={handleCountryClick}
    />
- Camera controls
  - <OrbitControls enablePan={false} enableZoom={true} />
- Theme toggle
  - <ThemeToggle />

Roadmap
- Improve performance with level-of-detail (LOD) techniques for GeoJSON polygons.
- Support additional data layers like climate, population, or trade routes.
- Add a panel with country details, along with historical data views.
- Expand the dataset to support micro-states and subnational regions.

Contributing
- We welcome contributions from developers of all experience levels.
- Start by forking the repo and opening a pull request with a clear description.
- Follow the existing code style and add tests for new features.
- Report issues with reproducible steps and relevant environment details.

Guidelines for contributors
- Keep changes small and focused on one feature or bug.
- Write tests for any new logic.
- Update documentation and examples to reflect changes.
- Be respectful and collaborative in discussion.

FAQ
- Do I need GPU support for WebGL?
  - Yes. Basic WebGL works on most modern devices, but GPU acceleration improves performance on large datasets.
- Can I run this without Next.js?
  - The codebase is designed around Next.js, but you can adapt the components to vanilla React with the appropriate bundler.
- How do I add a new GeoJSON source?
  - Place the GeoJSON file in data/, import it, and pass it to the GeoLayer. Ensure the features include valid geometry and properties.
